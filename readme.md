Circular Harmonics
===

An animated visualization of complex circular harmonics.
Circular harmonics (http://www.blackpawn.com/texts/ch/) are similar to spherical harmonics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics) except the dimensionality is reduced. 
By reducing the dimensionality, the extra dimensions are freed up which allows complex numbers to be visualized.
