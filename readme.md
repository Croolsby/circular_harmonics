Circular Harmonics
===

An animated visualization of complex circular harmonics.
Circular harmonics (http://www.blackpawn.com/texts/ch/) are similar to spherical harmonics (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics) except the dimensionality is reduced. 
By reducing the dimensionality, the extra dimensions are freed up which allows complex numbers to be visualized.

The ring in the center is a superposition of the first 9 harmonics. The 9 harmonics can be seen out in the background. The camera is rotating around the center ring, but the center ring is also rotating at a different rate.
